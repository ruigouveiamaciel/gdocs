-- The resource library is used to control what files are sent to clients who
-- join a server, this includes models, materials, sounds, text files but not
-- Lua files.
-- @library resource
-- @serverside

-- Adds the specified and all related files to the files the client should
-- download.
--
-- For convenience, this function will automatically add any other files that
-- are related to the selected one, and throw an error if it can't find them.
-- For example, a .vmt file will automatically add the .vtf with the same name,
-- and a .mdl file will automatically add all .vvd, .ani, .dx80.vtx, .dx90.vtx,
-- .sw.vtx, .phy and .jpg files with the same name, with a separate error for
-- each missing file.
--
-- If you do not want it to do this, use resource.AddSingleFile.
-- @tparam string path Virtual path of the file to be added, relative to
-- garrysmod/. Do not add .bz2 to the filepath. Do not put
-- gamemodes/*gamemodename*/content/ or addons/<*addonname*/ into the path.
function resource.AddFile(path) end

-- Adds the specified file to the files the client should download.
--
-- If you wish to add textures or models, consider using resource.AddFile to
-- add all the files required for a texture/model.
-- @tparam string path Path of the file to be added, relative to garrysmod/
function resource.AddSingleFile(path) end

-- Adds a workshop addon for the client to download before entering the server.
--
-- Having the raw files from a workshop item does not count as having already
-- downloaded it.
-- So players who previously downloaded a map through Fast Download will have
-- to re-download it if you use the workshop.
--
-- You should try to only add addons that have custom content ( models, sounds,
-- etc ).
--
-- Gamemodes that are workshop enabled are automatically added to this list -
-- so there's no need to add them.
--
-- The server's current map is also automatically added, if it is loaded from a
-- workshop addon.
-- @tparam string workshopid The workshop id of the file. This cannot be a
-- collection.
function resource.AddWorkshop(workshopid)
